# Roy Akash&mdash;@theroyakash 👋🏽
I am a research [scientist](https://g.co/kgs/zzwfzC), in high performance algorithms, data structures, distributed systems and beyond.

## What I'm doing?
- I’m currently working on fundamental computer science research in algorithms, data structures, parallel algorithms and distributed systems.
- I run a website called [algorithms.theroyakash.com](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com) which has huge collection of materials for FAANG and top startup's leetcode style coding interview questions and in-depth analysis along with C++ code. For some of the trickier questions a video explaination is also provided. I plan to expand the number of questions on the platform. This is a free initiative that I took. This website has more than a thousand unique weekly visitors.
