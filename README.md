# Roy Akash&mdash;@theroyakash 👋🏽
I am a research [scientist](https://g.co/kgs/zzwfzC), in high performance algorithms, data structures, safe computer vision systems, intelligent human-computer interaction and beyond.

## What I'm doing?
- I’m currently working on Fundamental computer science research in algorithms, data structures, parallel algorithms etc.
- I'm looking for collaborators (on C and Python > 3.9) on developing high performance tools in algorithms and data structures in AKDSFramework.

I am the author of several popular books in the fields of algorithms and computer programming. Python Basics To get Started is widely used to understand basic principals in Python language. I am currently writing a book on Deep Learning now named "Deep Learning and beyond" and also making an app to distribute deep learning material (videos and texts) for everyone to access for free.
