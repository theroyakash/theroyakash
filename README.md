I am a research [scientist](https://g.co/kgs/zzwfzC), in high performance algorithms, data structures, distributed systems and beyond.

## What I'm doing?
- Recently completed my internship at [Amazon India](www.amazon.in). Worked with the Registration and Core Services Team at Amazon Bangalore. Implemented a redirection feature for the production environment on the Amazon Worldwide Seller Portal which automatically redirects seller from Add new bank account page to the bank verification page. This improves customer experience, reduces time and effort for verifying bank accounts. Using WebLabs (selective deployment) we eventually deployed redirection feature to sellers in the United States.
  - During project we faced very rare edge-case, for which our redirection feature fails. In-order to solve this problem I designed and implemented foundational API changes along with suggestions from SDE-III. This code-base now acts as a foundation to migrate existing business logic from Service-Orchestration package to Service Management package which is picked-up by several existing SDE-I
- I‚Äôm currently working on fundamental computer science research in algorithms, data structures, parallel algorithms and distributed systems.
- I run a website called [algorithms.theroyakash.com](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com) which has huge collection of materials for FAANG and top startup's leetcode style coding interview questions and in-depth analysis along with C++ code. For some of the trickier questions a video explaination is also provided. I plan to expand the number of questions on the platform. This is a free initiative that I took. This website has more than a thousand unique weekly visitors.
